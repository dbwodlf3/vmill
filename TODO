//rewrite directory structure for where targets end up in vmill cmake and klee cmake
//delete external klee targets
start vmill impl for interpreter opts and abstract classes in klee
run something and see what happends I should expect a run time error for unimplemented remill functions 
write func defs for run time definitions (can use pre-built mcsema defs for referance) (klee uclibc?)
figure out how to load that byte code into klee
    - (LIKE LD PRELOAD) <probs not too bad just cmake changes to produce bitcode>
Transition to symbolic execution and write sceduler that manges vmill tasks
successfully wrap vmill with klee
add multithreaded support to vmill
start Libfuzzer stuff and use sanitizers to target good fuzz points <good idea because already lifting to llvm>
start cyberdyne and take snaphshot at these fuzz points run vmill run time on these
Enter into Rode0Day
Ball Out
